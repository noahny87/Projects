Welcome to my Github Repo hopefully this README finds you well and helps you with the navigation through my repo! 


Agprediction.Rmd 
- Created a multiple Linear regression model based around 3 crops corn, soybean and rice using packages from tidyverse and caret
- Used different demographic data of each crop to predict what a field should plant based on the levels of Potassium , Nitrogen and Phosphorus 
- along with this there were geographic levels to this like rain which was big predictor in deciding what to plant. 
- The data set for this is Crop_recommendation.csv obtained from Kaggle 


HeartEDA.Rmd 
- This is an exploratory data analysis looking into Ischaemic heart disease and how to predict it based on various factors such as chest pain , ECG values and ST slopes
- Hard project since I had to learn medical termonology and what means what. 
- used clustering and variable importance for looking for main predictors of heart disease 
- created different analysis of the data using packages like tidyverse , plotly, caret, randomForest, cluster and factoextra 
- data set used for this project is heart.csv 


Incometaxstate.py 
- this is a python file where i created the data set by gathering tax rates from all states in both the high and low brackets 
- Made a function where user inputs state and salary and it will output how much is taken out in taxes 
- first project where I did everything myself from data collection to creation 
- data used is Book1.csv 


MedicalinsuranceModel.R 
- This project is a script in R where i created a model to predict the medical insurance payments of a person based on multiple factors 
- factors such as: age, bmi, # of children, region, current charge, sex, and if they are a smoker or not 
- used multiple linear regression as my method of prediction
- used packages like caret, tidyverse, ggpairs 
- data set used for this is Medical_insurance.csv obtained from Kaggle 
 

weatherrmd.Rmd 
- This project is the most difficult where i predicted the weather for the day based on multiple factors 
- factors such as Date/Time , Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed , Visibility, Dew point, and Air pressure
- I used a classification regression tree model for this since the values i was predicting were char values (i.e. Snowy, cloudy , Sunny)
- This project required a lot of feature engineering since most weather values that were initially in the data set were very similar to others i.e. Snowy, flurry and flurry are indestinguishable when experiencing each
- Made into an interactive R dashboard rmd allowing user to input their values for the day and return a weather outcome. 
- packages used in this project are rpart, tidyverse, caret, and shiny 
- data set used for this is Weather Data.csv obtained from Kaggle 

MedicalInsuranceChargesReg 
- This is a polynomial regression model used to predict the medical insurance charges for any single person. 
- The predictor values are smoker(yes,no), age(int), bmi(int) against response variable charges 
- Data was manipulated to turn all binary values to 1 and 0 
- Correlation plot used to find relationships amongst the variables against charges to use in model. 
- Model achieves 74% accuracy 
- Data taken from Kaggle
